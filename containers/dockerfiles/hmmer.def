%help
    HMMER container for MSA generation via jackhmmer.
    
    Tools included:
        - hmmsearch  - search profile HMM against sequence database
        - hmmscan    - search sequence against profile HMM database
        - jackhmmer  - iteratively search sequence against database
        - phmmer     - search single sequence against database
        - hmmbuild   - build profile HMM from alignment
    
    Usage:
        apptainer exec hmmer.sif jackhmmer \
            -A output.sto \
            --cpu 4 \
            query.fasta \
            /db/uniref90.fasta

%environment
    export LC_ALL=C
